# First Steps with Go
This is a very quick guide to know a little more about Go language.

## Important commands
To know the current version of Go just use:
```
go version
```

If you want to see the documentation of an specific package you can run
```
go doc [package name]. e.g. go doc fmt
```

To run a specific file just use:
```
go run [file name]. e.g. go run hello_world.go
```

To set format to a go file you can use:
```
go fmt [file name]. e.g. go fmt hello_world.go
```

To compile and create a executable file you can run:
```
go build [file name]. e.g. go build hello_world.go
```
